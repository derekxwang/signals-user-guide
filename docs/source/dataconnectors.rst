**3rd party data connectors** are ways to access data owned by your organization but stored in 3rd party systems.
Examples include salesforce, Google Analytics, and Zendesk among many others.


**Public data connectors** allow you to access data that anyone can view on the internet, but in a uniform format.
We collect data from Amazon, Facebook, the Google Play store, consumeraffairs.com, and many other sites.


Our **Enterprise Data Connector** is used to connect to internal databases or other 1st party data platforms in your organization.
