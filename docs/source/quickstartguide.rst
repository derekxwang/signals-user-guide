Quick Start Guide
=================


1. Begin by :doc:`createaccount`, next, log in and check out some of the pre-built public dashboards in the folders on the homepage. 


!TODO - public dashboard images/examples


2. To create your own dashboard, click "Create a new Dashboard". Connect to your database, upload a CSV or Excel file, or use one of our :doc:`dataconnectors` for easy access to a wealth of publicly available data. Add as many data source to your dashboard as needed.



3. If you're bringing your own data, specify which fields contain Textual, Temporal, or Geographical information for analysis and normalization. All other fields will be brought in as pivot points and additional visualizations. See the :doc:`mapdata` guide for more details.



4. Your dashboard will contain visualizations based on the type of data in your analysis by default. See the guide on our :doc:`signalsanalyticsengine` for information on how to interpret these visualizations. Every visualization is clickable, and clicking will apply a filter on your data based on your selection.



5. Now you're ready to :doc:`widgeteditor` using your other datapoints to hone in on interesting segments within your data and discover topics and themes within your textual data.



6. Click on the "Data" tab to view the original documents. If you've filtered down to a subset of your data in your dashboard, you'll see only those documents.
