Creating a Dashboard
====================

The dashboard interface is extremely flexible, allowing them to be used for both passive monitoring as well as active deep-dive or root-cause analysis.


Dashboards are interactive and allow you to visualize and pivot on your data from multiple facets, analyzing them holistically or granularly. A Dashboard can hold multiple datasets for disparate data sources.


Dashboards are made up of widgets, or custom visualizations of your data. A dashboard can be split into multiple tabs to create focus areas within your dashboard. The level of connectedness between tabs is customizable. Interactions can affect the entire dashboard, just certain tabs, or only the tab you're on. See the :doc:`tabs` page to learn more about this.
