Quick Start Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Begin by :doc:`createaccount`, next, log in and check out some of the pre-built public dashboards in the folders on the homepage. 



2. To create your own dashboard, click "Create a new Dashboard". Connect to your database, upload a CSV or Excel file, or use one of our :doc:`dataconnectors` for easy access to a wealth of publicly available data. Add as many data source to your dashboard as needed.



3. If you're bringing your own data, specify which fields contain Textual, Temporal, or Geographical information for analysis and normalization. All other fields will be brought in as pivot points and additional visualizations. See the :doc:`mapdata` guide for more details.



4. Your dashboard will contain visualizations based on the type of data in your analysis by default. See the guide on our :doc:`signalsanalyticsengine` for information on how to interpret these visualizations. Every visualization is clickable, and clicking will apply a filter on your data based on your selection.



5. Now you're ready to :doc:`widgeteditor` using your other datapoints to hone in on interesting segments within your data and discover topics and themes within your textual data.



6. Click on the "Data" tab to view the original documents. If you've filtered down to a subset of your data in your dashboard, you'll see only those documents.




FAQ

**Where Does the name "Stratifyd" come from?**

  Stratifyd is a unique way of spelling Stratified Sampling, which is a statistical method that illustrates the peeling of layers and layers of data to derive a proper statistical result. We took the name Stratifyd to emphasize on the next-gen Data Analytics that will be mathematically sound and interpretable by human. This truly reflects our company mission on provideing an Augmented Intelligence environment that leverages Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human's Decision Making process. 

  For more reading on Stratified: In statistics, stratified sampling is a method of sampling from a population. In statistical surveys, when subpopulations within an overall population vary, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently.

**Is there a limit to how much data I can upload or analyze?**

  Trial accounts are limited to 30MB uploads.

  While there is no limit on Enterprise accounts, the web interface only supports up to 500MB files. Larger iles should be uploaded via the _`Signals SDK`
