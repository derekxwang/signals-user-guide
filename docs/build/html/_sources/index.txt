  Stratifyd is a unique way of spelling Stratified Sampling, which is a statistical method that illustrates the peeling of layers and layers of data to derive a proper statistical result. We took the name Stratifyd to emphasize on the next-gen Data Analytics that will be mathematically sound and interpretable by human.
